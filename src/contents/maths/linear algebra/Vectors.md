## What is Vectors?

**vectors are why to describe motion with maths** they exist in **Euclidean
space**. euclidean space is mathematical concept that describes geometric space
intended to
represent [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space").
euclidean space can have **n**-spaces where **"n"** can be any positive integer.

## Difference between vector and points

{/* plain where user will define a point based on input x and y */} **"Points
are used to describe locations in space"** and they are _dependent of there
coordinate system_ means points form one coordinate system will have different
**different coordinates** in other system.

Vectors are similar to points but unlike points they are independent of any
coordinate system. while points represent a specific position in space, vectors
describe **motion with direction** or quantities with both **magnitude** (size)
and **direction**.

## Vector Algebra

### Vector

#### Addition

Add corresponding components of two vectors.

#### Subtraction

Subtract corresponding components of two vectors.

#### Cross Product

Produces a new vector perpendicular to the two input vectors.

#### Scalar

#### Multiplication

Multiply each component of a vector by a scalar. because **scalar scales the
vector**

#### Dot Product

### Magnitude of a Vector

### Unit Vector
