# What is Vectors?
**vectors are why to describe motion with math** they exist in **Euclidean space**. euclidean space is mathematical concept that describes geometric space intended to representÂ [physical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_space "Physical space"). euclidean space can have **n**-spaces where **"n"** can be any positive integer.

## Difference between vector and points

**"Points are used to describe locations in space"** and they are *dependent of there coordinate system* means points form one coordinate system will have different **different coordinates** in other system.

Vectors are similar to points but unlike points they are independent of any coordinate system. while points represent a specific position in space, vectors describe **motion with direction** or quantities with both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**.
