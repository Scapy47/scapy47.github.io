# Vectors
**Euclidean Space** is representation of physical space in geometry. Euclidean Space has many uses such as
* Physics and engineering for modeling physical world 
* machine learning to identify similarity or dissimilarity between data points 
* graphics for to display what you see on a display

**Euclidean space** is made up of **n**-spaces here **n** is positive integer and can be imagined as scale in a graph. which is very useful because concepts like force and fields can be imagined or calculated with mathematical operations just like we do for graphs.

## Then what is vector?
**vectors are a way of describing movement in Euclidean space with math.**
in Euclidean space every dimension is a scale so with that we can say we live in 3 dimensional world cause anything can be measured in three dimensions **height, width and depth**
