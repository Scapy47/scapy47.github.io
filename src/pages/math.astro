    <p>
        arithmetic fonumentals of math is made of addition substraction multiplication division
        but addition and substraction are most fonumentals of them all because 
        multiplication is just repeted addition and division is just repeted substraction
        and if go further se something exponents are just repeted multiplication and radicals
        are also just repeted division
